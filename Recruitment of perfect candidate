Q)  OUT OF TABLE WITH CADIDATE ID AND THEIR SKILLS , YOU HAVE TO SELECT THE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE 3 SKILLS 
SQL , PYTHON AND TABLEAU. IF CANDIDATES HAVE THESE 3 SKILLS ALONG WITH OTHERS IS GOOD , IF THEY ONLY HAVE THESE 3 SKILLS 
WHICH IS ALSO FINE. BUT NOT HAVING 1 SKILLS OUT OF THREE WILL MLEAD TO REJECTION

123 : TABLEAU
234  : SQL
123 : PYTHON
123 : SQL
234  : R
567 : POWERBI

SOLUTION : THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING 2 METHODS

METHOD 1 : WE WILL USE CTE WHICH WILL HAVE ROWS RELATED TO SQL , PYTHON , TABLEAU. AFTER THAT WE WILL APPLY GROUP BY 

WITH CTE AS 
(SELECT * 
 FROM TABLE 
 WHERE SKILLS 
 IN ('SQL' , 'PYTHON' , 'TABLEAU')),

CTE_TWO AS
(SELECT 
 ID , COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_COUNT 
 FROM CTE 
 GROUP BY 1)

SELECT ID FROM CTE_TWO WHERE TOTAL_COUNT = 3

  METHOD 2: IN THIS METHOD WE WILL BE USING THE STRING _AGG FUNCTION

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT 
ID , 
STRING_AGG('SKILLS' , ',' ORDER BY SKILLS) AS ALL_SKILLS 
FROM TABLE
GROUP BY ID)

SELECT 
ID 
FROM CTE 
WHERE ALL_SKILLS LIKE '%SQL , PYTHON , TABLEAU%' ;
